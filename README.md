# Pandas Challenge

This repository contains the necessary script in a Jupyter Notebook as requested for the Pandas Challenge. The notebook also includes the short analysis of the data.

## Dependencies

This Jupyter Notebook was handcrafted in *Visual Studio Code* and tested in *Python 3.11.0* by opening the terminal within the directory containing the notebook and running the following command:

```python
jupyter notebook 'PyCitySchools.ipynb'
```
Dependencies are included in the notebook.

## Credits

As usual, for minor syntax help and for the Pandas documentation, Stack Overflow and the various notes from class were used to help with this project, especially messing around with the class activity notebooks that we couldn't go over in detail. The usual study group was also helpful in getting through this project, and at some point, we'll need to come up with a name for this crew.
Professor Irfan is to thank as always for the starter code and the patience to deal with all of our questions, no matter how asinine they may be.

Coding Soundtrack for this week was Bad Omens' album, [The Death of Peace of Mind](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lh0bDNBVq-M8wmwOAzP35hRuxloE9KN5E).

## Editor's Note
Certain names of databases and variables were changed to make it easier to work with in my head. I know there were certain names asked of us to be used in our code, but I found it easier to work with the names I used. I hope this doesn't cause any grading issues.
